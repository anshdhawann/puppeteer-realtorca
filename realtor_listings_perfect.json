      "PublicRemarks": "RARE FIND! 1000+ sqft CONDO with gorgeous, unobstructed South AND West Views from TWO massive balconies! SW CORNER END UNIT in prestigious Cameron Court, Lower Mount Royal. IN-SUITE LAUNDRY, TWO BATHROOMS, One bedroom PLUS DEN/OFFICE/NOOK area that could be re-imagined as a SECOND BEDROOM (see drawing in photos #46) with its own balcony and closet. SUPERB LOCATION! Lower Mount Royal is one of the top 10 most walkable neighbourhoods... just steps from 17th Avenue, 10 minutes to Marda Loop and the downtown core, an easy jaunt to all amenities including vibrant shops, services, restaurants, coffee shops, public transportation and groceries (Co-op, Safeway and Save on Foods). Listen to the birds chirping in the mature trees surrounding the complex while you enjoy a morning java and stellar views from the privacy of your own big, beautiful balconies where you have a 180 degree, clear view of downtown, the Foothills Hospital, the University buildings, McMahon stadium and the Calgary Stampede Grounds. The beautiful brick façade of only 20 units runs five stories high and wraps around the entire edifice. This bright, sunny condo has a dedicated living room, dining room and kitchen with a connected office/den or breakfast nook, a 4-piece private bathroom. The second 3-piece en-suite bathroom is in the large primary bedroom that also has 2 walk in his/hers closets and a cushioned window bench (extra storage here) where you can relax and read your favourite novel.  The fireplace is currently decommissioned, but could either be entirely removed for more floor space or remodeled to fit an electric fireplace. Upgrades include beautiful Brazilian hardwood flooring, newer windows & 2 balcony doors (w/in 5yrs),  all window coverings (w/in 3yrs), fresh paint, newer stove and more… Must be seen to be appreciated.

      "PublicRemarks": "Have you been dreaming about a new lifestyle with fewer chores around the house and and more time to work on your golf game?  Do you love the idea of winter getaways while someone else clears the snow off your sidewalk and driveway?  Would you like a walkout bungalow villa in the Hamptons (backing on the golf course) that won't break the bank?  Come see 169 Hamptons Link NW.  The bungalow villas at 'La Vita' have great exterior appeal, both from the street and the golf course.  Tile roofing and stucco siding are both upscale and  low-maintenance.  With just under 1200 SQ.FT.. on the main level (plus a finished basement), you can upgrade your lifestyle while downsizing your space.   Park your vehicles in the comfort of the insulated and drywalled double attached garage.  Step in the front door and you will instantly appreciate the near-flawless, warm-toned, site-finished hardwood flooring that runs through most of the main level and down the stairs to the basement!  With a sunny southeast exposure, this villa is nice and bright on both levels.  The kitchen has a central island with eating bar, plus a great corner pantry.  Natural wood exteriors adorn the cabinets (plus crown molding at the upper cabinets for classic elegance).  Nine foot ceilings make the home feel even more spacious!  The living room has a cozy corner fireplace (natural gas) to keep you comfy all year round.   Step out onto the back deck which has a durable and low-maintenance vinyl surface with aluminum railing & glass inserts.  You will love having a view that will make you want to stay outdoors all summer long!  Gas line for your BBQ.   Whether you still work a bit for a living or just want a separate reading or TV room, the office is perfectly situated near the front entry.  The half bathroom for your guests is nicely tucked away from the kitchen and living room.   At the end of the day, enjoy your personal retreat in your primary bedroom (which is large enough for your king bed), with double cl osets and a 4-piece ensuite bathroom!  Head downstairs to the walkout level to find another bedroom, full bathroom, large rec room, and an additional hobby or exercise space.  There is plenty of storage so that downsizing is not such a shock to the system :)  You could create additional developed space if you don't need a large storage area.   The condo fees here are not too painful, and the benefit is great.  Sip your coffee while the lawn and snow are managed by others.   It's not too often that a villa at this price becomes available on the Hamptons Golf Course.   Book your showing today! (30670109)",
